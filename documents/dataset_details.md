## images_scan_area file naming rule
- img(texture_id).jpg
- example: img0.jpg


## sensor_data file naming rule
- (texture_id)\_(direction)\_(velocity)\_(force)\_(repeat count).csv or .wav

### texture_id
[texture list](texture_list.pdf)

### direction
clockwise angle(degree)  
(0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degree)

### velocity
scan speed (mm/s)  
(20, 30, 40, 50, 60 mm/s)

### force
push force (mN)  
(500 or 1000 mN)

### repeat count
numbers of scan  
(0 or 1)

### example: 0_135_40_500_0.csv  
- texture id: 0
- direction 135 degree
- velocity 40 mm/s
- force 500 mN
- repeat count: 0
